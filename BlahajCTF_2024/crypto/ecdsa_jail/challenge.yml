description: I heard jails are tough to protect, so I wrote an ECDSA algorithm such that any input code must be signed with my own private key in order for them to be executed! I heard there's a nasty CVE-2022-21449 vulnerability concerning input validation, so I made a quick patch to it! It should be secure now, right?
