this is a direct implementation of the drunken bishop randomart algorithm used by openssh (http://www.dirk-loss.de/sshvis/drunken_bishop.pdf), and since the fingerprint is given, you just find a cycle in the walk and submit that.

if challenge becomes too confusing to interact with, partial source will be provided.
