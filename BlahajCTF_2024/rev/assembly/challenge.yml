description: Greetings reverse engineer! Here I've got a simple scrap of assembly source code written in MIPS. All I need of you is to determine the correct value of `flag` so that the `main` function returns `0` and not `-1` (in other words, the final value of the `a0` register is `0`)! Once solved, submit your flag as `blahaj{flag}` where `flag` is typed out in hex (e.g. `0xdeadbeef`). 

value: 500
type: dynamic
decay: 40
minimum: 100

flags:
    - blahaj{0x5caff01d}

files:
    - dist/challenge.s
